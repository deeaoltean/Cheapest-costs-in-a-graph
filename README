    Functions:
createGraphAdjList  ------> Allocate memory for a new graph and initialize
                            the number of nodes of the graph.
addEdgeList ------> Add a new edge into the graph which means that we add the
                    two nodes in the list of each one. The nodes are added at
                    the beginning of the list.

bfsGL ------> Breadth first search. The elements of the graph are added into
              the queue, only if it was not visited before.
c_edgeCase  ------> Determine the number of conex elements and calculate the
                    minimum cost of a route.
destroyGraphAdjList ------> Frees all the memory from a graph.
